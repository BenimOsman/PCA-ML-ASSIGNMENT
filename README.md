# PCA-ML-ASSIGNMENT

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
To understand and implement PCA and compare its performance in terms of Variance, Error, Accuracy.

**Dataset:** You can choose any dataset of your interest from publicly available datasets or use your own dataset.
**Tasks:**
1. Load the dataset and perform necessary preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, scaling, etc.
2. Implement PCA from scratch using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib, and apply it to the dataset.
3. Use the scikit-learn library to apply PCA to the dataset and compare the results with the implementation from scratch.
4. Visualize the results of PCA using Matplotlib or any other visualization library of your choice.
5. Evaluate the performance of PCA by calculating the explained variance ratio for each principal component and selecting the appropriate number of principal components for the dataset.
6. Use the selected number of principal components to reconstruct the original dataset and calculate the reconstruction error.
7. Compare the results of PCA with and without dimensionality reduction using a classification algorithm of your choice, such as logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, or support vector machines.

**Note:** You are encouraged to use additional libraries or tools if you think they could be helpful for your analysis.
